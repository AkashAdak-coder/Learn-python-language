#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found
#in other object-orientated programming languages.

#hum for loop ko tupple, list ke undar stor kar sakte he

friend = ["akash", "alock", "sumit"]
for x in friend:
  print(x)

nums = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
for i in nums: # nums ka  velu i ke undar stor hoge
  print(i)
