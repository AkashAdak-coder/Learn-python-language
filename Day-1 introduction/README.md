# Python Introduction
## What is a program?
A ***program*** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The
computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or
finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or
playing a video.

- ***Input:*** Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.
- ***Output:*** Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.
- ***Math:*** Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
- ***Conditional execution:*** Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.

### It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics
- system scripting.

### What can Python do?
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

### Why Python?
- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

## Good to Know üìù  
- üîπ The latest stable version is **Python 3** (recommended for use).
- üîπ Python 2 is still used but only receives security updates.
- üîπ Python code can be written in any **text editor** or in an **IDE** like:
  - **Thonny**
  - **PyCharm**
  - **NetBeans**
  - **Eclipse**

## Python Syntax vs Other Languages üñ•Ô∏è  
- ‚úÖ **Readability** ‚Äì Python is designed to be **clean and easy to read**, similar to English.
- ‚úÖ **Line Endings** ‚Äì Uses **new lines** instead of semicolons (`;`) or parentheses.
- ‚úÖ **Indentation** ‚Äì Uses **whitespace (indentation)** to define scope (loops, functions, classes), unlike other languages that use curly braces `{}`.

üìå **Example:**  
```python
# Python print function
print("Hello, World!")

```
